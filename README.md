# Smart Alarm Clock
 
## What is it?
This is an alarm clock that responds to lighting conditions and is designed for students in mind using 2 Arduino. The 'slave.ino' code that I had written contains the logic for detecting the light conditions and responding to them as well as communicating with the master Arduino. The 'master.ino' code which was written by another student (see reference below) contains the logic for confMaiguring the smart alarm display as well as communicating with the slave Arduino.
